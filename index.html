          Sir Elton John has shared that he's been struggling with his eyesight since an infection last summer, which now prevents him from doing everyday things like watching TV or seeing his sons play rugby and football.
          “I can’t see the television, I can’t read. I can’t watch my boys play rugby and football,” the 78-year-old singer told The Times.
          “It’s been a very difficult time because I’m used to taking everything in. It’s distressing,” he added.
          Back in September, Elton revealed on Instagram that a “serious” infection had left him with “limited vision” in one eye, noting that his recovery “would take time.”

          Sir Elton John and his filmmaker husband, David Furnish, have two sons, Zachary and Elijah.  
          He shared that he “can’t see the telly” and revealed, “I haven’t been able to see anything since last July.”  
          He admitted that the loss of his vision has taken an emotional toll. “I do get emotional about it,” he said.  
          “But you have to adapt,” he continued. “I’m lucky to have the life I have. I still have my wonderful family, and I can still see a little out of here,” he added, pointing to his left eye.  
          “So you just say to yourself, get on with it.”

          Sir Elton previously shared that his vision problems had prevented him from completing his new album.  
          However, on Friday, he released a new collaborative album with Brandi Carlile titled <strong>Who Believes In Angels?</strong> with producer Andrew Watt and longtime partner Bernie Taupin.  
          “We didn’t all agree,” Elton admitted. “If I want to make a great album at 76 or 77, I need to be told the truth — and they put up with my little foibles, which were really about anxiety, self-doubt, and not feeling very well at the time.”  
          Despite his doubts, the album has received critical acclaim and marks another highlight in his career.
